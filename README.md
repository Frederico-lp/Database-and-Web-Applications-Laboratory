## Project 
RedWood is a web based information system that supports an Online bookstore. The tool allows users to view and buy any book available, be that a physical or e-book.
We implemented a search feature capable of searching by book title and author, a “cart” where any books added would be ready to purchase, as well as options to manage said cart. A manageable wishlist was also implemented, as well as a rigorous order system that supports checkout, viewing the status of any current order.
Registered users have a profile they can change and manage however they please, and administrative tools for admin users to use, so they can manage users, books and orders.
